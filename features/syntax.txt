Type -> easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

Primitive Types - number, boolean, string, null, undefined, symbol, void
Object Types - functions, arays, classes, objects

Why do we care? 
- Types are used by the typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors
-Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our    codebase

Where do we use types: EVERYWHERE


Type Annotations and Type Inference 

Type annotations (work we do) - Code we add to tell typescript what type of value avariable will refer to

Type inference (work typescript does) - Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

annotations:
when to use: 
  -when we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
  -when we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
  -when a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value


inference:
variable declaration     variable initialization
  { const color }    =   'red'
  if declaration and initializationare on the same line, Typescrip will figure out the type of 'color' for us.
